## Obstacles faced during development
``
Restarted page due to having a more complete understanding of certain aspects of development. 
This was created using a template and any time the portfolio section is updated it breaks.
```
## Instructions for future development
```
I wil be continually updating this page with my  most recent projects. I would also like  to add in more  sections and make the email form functional.
